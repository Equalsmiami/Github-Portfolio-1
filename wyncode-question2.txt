Estimate-Ability

Question:
Reflect back on your life. How many times has something that youâ€™ve worked on been:

- more complicated than you expected
- less complicated than you expected
- exactly as complicated as you expected
Do you have a tendency to underestimate, overestimate, or are you spot-on most of the time?

Answer: 
In the few freelancing jobs I taken on over the past year, I have had a tendency to over-estimate. I believe this was intended as a buffer for unforeseen complications which may occur during development. After reviewing the slides and reflecting on the in class lecture, I realize this may reflect negatively as if I am over charging the customer for my work. Moving forward, I believe I will adopt a relative estimate when setting expectations.
